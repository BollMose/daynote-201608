I played basketball on Sunday moring in spite of hurting my finger last time. Consequently it was hueted again.

My daughter was not ready to go to sleep last night, she cannot fall asleep until 11:00 pm, at last we all were tierd, 
and she counted in english, one, two, three...twenty eight, twenty nine and twenty ten.

My wife, my daughter and I: If my daughter is in good performance, my wife says: my daughter ...;
but if she is in poor performance, your daughter instead.
